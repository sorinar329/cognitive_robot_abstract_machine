"""Semantic map definition for IAI kitchen environment.

This module provides semantic map definitions for the IAI kitchen environment,
defining regions and their spatial relationships. It specifies the physical
layout and semantic annotations of the kitchen space.

The semantic map includes:

* Region definitions with dimensions
* Spatial relationships between regions
* Frame transformations
* Semantic annotations for regions

.. note::
    This semantic map is specifically designed for the IAI kitchen environment
    and includes detailed specifications for regions like the kitchen island.
