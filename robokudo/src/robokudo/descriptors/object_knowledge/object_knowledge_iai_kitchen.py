"""Object knowledge base for IAI kitchen environment.

This module provides object knowledge definitions for the IAI kitchen environment,
specifically focusing on common kitchen objects and their features. It defines
object dimensions, poses, and part relationships.

The knowledge base includes:

* Object definitions with dimensions
* Part relationships and hierarchies
* Feature specifications
* Pose information for objects and parts

.. note::
    This knowledge base is specifically designed for the IAI kitchen environment
    and includes detailed specifications for objects like mugs with their
    openings and bottoms.
