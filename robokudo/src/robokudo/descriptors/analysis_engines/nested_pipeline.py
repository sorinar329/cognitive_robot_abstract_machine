"""Analysis engine demonstrating nested pipeline functionality.

This module provides an analysis engine that demonstrates how to create and use
nested pipelines within the main processing pipeline. It implements a main pipeline
with a nested belief state pipeline that runs in parallel.

The pipeline implements the following functionality:

* Main pipeline with Kinect camera input
* Nested belief state pipeline with counting annotators
* Conditional execution based on belief state
* Visualization redraw control

.. note::
    This is a demonstration pipeline that shows how to structure complex
    processing flows using nested pipelines and conditional execution.
