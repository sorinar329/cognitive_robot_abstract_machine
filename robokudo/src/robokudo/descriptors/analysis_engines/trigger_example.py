"""Analysis engine demonstrating pipeline trigger functionality.

This module provides an analysis engine that demonstrates how to use pipeline
triggers to control the execution flow. It implements a pipeline that waits for
user input (keypress) before processing each frame from a Kinect camera.

The pipeline implements the following functionality:
- Pipeline trigger for user-controlled execution
- Reading data from a Kinect camera
- Image preprocessing
- Simulated slow processing (for demonstration)

.. note::
    This example is particularly useful for debugging and step-by-step analysis
    of pipeline behavior, as it allows manual control over frame processing.
