"""Analysis engine for writing stored data to filesystem.

This module provides an analysis engine that demonstrates how to read data from
MongoDB storage and write it to the local filesystem. It implements a simple
pipeline for data transfer between storage systems.

The pipeline implements the following functionality:

* Reading stored data from MongoDB
* Image preprocessing
* Writing data to local filesystem

.. note::
    This engine requires a properly configured MongoDB database with stored data.
    The data will be written to the local filesystem in a format compatible with
    the FileReader interface.
