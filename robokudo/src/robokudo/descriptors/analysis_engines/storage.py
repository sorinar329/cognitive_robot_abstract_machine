"""Analysis engine for recording sensor data to storage.

This module provides an analysis engine that demonstrates how to record sensor
data from a Kinect camera to storage. It implements a simple pipeline that
captures, preprocesses, and stores camera data for later use.

The pipeline implements the following functionality:

* Reading data from a Kinect camera
* Image preprocessing
* Data storage using StorageWriter

.. note::
    This engine can be configured to use either a standard Kinect camera
    configuration or one without transform lookup, depending on the application
    requirements.
