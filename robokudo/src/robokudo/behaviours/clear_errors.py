"""
Error handling behavior for RoboKudo behavior trees.

This module provides a behavior that clears error states stored on the behavior
tree's blackboard. It is typically used:

* At the start of a pipeline to ensure a clean error state
* After error recovery to reset error flags
* Before starting new processing sequences

The behavior integrates with RoboKudo's error handling system to manage
error states across the behavior tree.
