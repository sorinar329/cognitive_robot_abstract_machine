"""Computer vision types for Robokudo.

This module provides types for computer vision operations including:

* 2D and 3D point representations
* Rectangle and region of interest definitions
* 3D bounding box specifications

The types support integration with:
* OpenCV for image processing
* Open3D for point cloud handling
* Transform system for poses
