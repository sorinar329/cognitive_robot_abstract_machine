"""Transform and pose types for Robokudo.

This module provides types for representing poses, positions, and transforms
in 3D space. It includes both timestamped and non-timestamped variants.

The module supports:

* 6-DOF poses (translation + rotation)
* 3-DOF positions (translation only)
* Reference frame specifications
* Timestamped variants
* Parent-child frame relationships
