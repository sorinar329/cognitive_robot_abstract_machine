"""
Deterministic executor for the stacked-PR maintenance pass.

``stack.py`` derives what a pass should do and prints it; nothing in it moves a commit.
Every fetch, merge, rebase and push in the workflow was therefore performed by a session
following prose, and ``board.json`` was hand-assembled from whatever the caller happened
to fetch - the same class of hand-assembled input that let a dropped ``merged_at`` field
read as a legitimate value.

This module is the command line onto the modules that perform those steps::

    python -m basstler.maintenance board --write     # export the fork's open pull requests
    python -m basstler.maintenance fast-forward      # move the fork's base onto the upstream
    python -m basstler.maintenance restack           # integrate every moved parent, report every conflict
    python -m basstler.maintenance promote           # record the upstream link on every ready branch
    python -m basstler.maintenance run-report --json # the whole pass as one document

It executes an already-derived plan: structure still comes from ``stack.py`` and from
GitHub's own stack object. Retargeting a pull request's **base branch** is the one write
GitHub refuses to the credential this runs on - probed directly, alongside the label,
comment and description writes it does allow - so that step alone is reported for the
caller to perform through the GitHub MCP server.

The exit status is the result. ``run-report --json`` is the machine-readable form, so a
scheduled job with no model in the loop can emit it directly.
