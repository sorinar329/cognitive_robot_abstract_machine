"""
What this package contains, discovered rather than listed.

Which modules exist and which of them answer as a command line are both read from the
package itself - the directory, and each module's own source. Nothing about the package
is written down here.

No module is held to the standard library: the dependencies are installed before anything
runs one. A session gets them from ``session-start.sh``, which installs whatever is
missing on every start, and an Actions workflow installs them in a step of its own.
