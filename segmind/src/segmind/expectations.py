"""
What is expected of a thing something acted on, and what a look reports when it finds
otherwise.

An action says what it will do before it does it, and Segmind says what was seen to
happen. Both speak the world's own vocabulary: released over a hole, a thing is expected
to lie in that hole's region, within a release's spread of it; each event then says
which relations hold of the thing from then on, which stop holding, and which it is a
reason to check; and a thing nothing has acted on keeps exactly what was last believed
of it. That last rule is what makes a history worth keeping, since it is what lets a
belief hold across every frame in which nothing happened.

Looking becomes checking once a belief exists. The relations expected of a thing are the
relations a look is asked for, and what the look finds is asked the same relations, so
*which* of them it contradicts -- in the hole or beside it, on the lid or on the table,
turned this way or that -- is what a recovery can act on. That is the difference between
a failure and an absence.
