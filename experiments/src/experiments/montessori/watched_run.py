A sorting run watched while it happens: an event monitor ticks against the piece the
script acts on, the frozen working-memory question set is asked at the step the scene is
asked about, what a look made of the robot's own account of the scene is scored as the
look is taken, and every motion state chart a step runs is kept as it finishes.

All of it goes through the run's observer, so the trial the run records carries its
ticks, its scored queries and the motions it ran rather than only its outcome.
