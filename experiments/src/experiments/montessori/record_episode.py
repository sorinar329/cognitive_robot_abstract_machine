"""
Record one episode of a Montessori sorting scenario: the scenario, its layout, the
perturbation applied to it, where it runs and where its scene comes from are chosen on
the command line, the run is watched by the event monitor and asked the question set,
and its trials, its video, its transcript and its bag are kept under the episode's
identifier.

The scene is either built from Tracy's description, for a run in simulation, or
perceived: the world is fetched from the robot and the board and the pieces are stood in
it by the robot's own camera, which is what a run on the robot is set among. A perceived
scene is laid out by nobody here, so its layout is read off what the camera found.

The identifier is printed before anything else, so a run that dies can still be found in
the database and asked about.
