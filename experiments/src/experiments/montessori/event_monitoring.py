"""
Live segmind event monitoring for the Franka Montessori demo: while a simulation is
running, tick a small segmind statechart so pick-up and insertion events are detected as
they happen, rather than only checked for after the fact via :meth:`~experiments.montess
ori.insert_shape_action.InsertMontessoriShapeAction.has_fallen_through_hole`.

A monitor tracks one shape at a time (see :func:`build_shape_monitor`), which measures a
tick at about 12 ms on this scene, inside a single control period. Tracking every loose
shape on the table at once needs the broader collision-broad-phase optimization tracked
separately, not yet done.

Ticking happens on the thread running the motion being watched, never on one of its own
-- see :class:`ControlCycleTicking` for what a second thread costs here, and
:class:`WatchesNothing` for the run that would rather not pay for detection at all.
