"""
The loose Montessori pieces this lab's physical sets actually contain.

Every measurement here was taken off the pieces themselves rather than derived from the
board's own holes: a piece is cut smaller than the hole it drops through, so the hole's
footprint is the wrong size to recognise a piece by or to build one from.

There are two sets, and a look is told which one stands on the table: the set the
captures of August 2026 hold, and a smaller set of the same four kinds printed at four
fifths of it in different plastic, which is the one on the table since September 2026.

Each piece is described by the outline it presents while resting on its own flat face,
the colour it was measured to be, and how far it can be turned about its standing axis
before it looks as it did. That last one is what makes a piece's orientation a *minimal*
turn rather than an absolute one: a square is unchanged by a quarter turn, so there is
no sense in reporting that it was turned by more.
