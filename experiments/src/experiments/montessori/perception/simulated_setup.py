The simulated Montessori rig: where the camera stands over the table, and the pipeline
that reads what it sees.

The counterpart of :mod:`~experiments.montessori.perception.recorded_setup`, which
describes the real table the six captures were taken over. The real one has to restate
what a recording carries no world for; this one reads the same things off the twin that
built the scene, so a surface is measured of the very body a statement names.
