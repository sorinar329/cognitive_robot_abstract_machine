"""
Where a surface reaches, worked out from what the world says it is like.

Every surface this package searches has so far been taken from a model: a rectangle
written down for the recordings, or the widest horizontal face of the body the twin
places. Neither is a measurement of where the table really is, and this scene has
already drifted away from its own model once.

So a surface is *described* instead -- how it takes light, and how far the world says it
reaches -- and which finder answers that description is a rule over it, exactly as
:mod:`~experiments.montessori.perception.detector_choice` decides which detector reads a
piece off a surface. The rules are krrood's
:class:`~krrood.entity_query_language.rdr.single_class.EQLSingleClassRDR`, built from the
underspecified statement *a surface whose finder is to be worked out*, so what is
described and what is left open are read off that statement rather than named again
here. A surface the world says colour cannot outline is measured in the depth image; one
it says nothing about is taken from the model, because a description nothing states is
not one a look can be compiled from.

..note:: A plane fit answers the *surface* and not what rests on it. The point-cloud
    trial this measurement follows found a plane holding a third of the points on the
    bare steel and no piece standing out of that cloud at all, which is why pieces are
    read by fitting known outlines to edges instead.
