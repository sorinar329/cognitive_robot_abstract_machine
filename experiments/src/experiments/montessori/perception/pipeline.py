"""
Find the Montessori board, its holes, and the loose pieces in one RGB-D frame.

The scene splits into two horizontal surfaces, and each is rectified and searched on its
own: the table, and the board's raised lid, which carries the holes and takes a loose
piece just as the table does. Rectifying each surface at its own height is what keeps
what lies on it accurate -- read off the table's plane instead, the lid's outline is
magnified by the ratio of the two camera distances, which walks the outer holes several
centimetres away from where they are and pushes a piece standing on the lid out of its
own silhouette altogether.

Colour says where to look and edges say what is there. The pieces are brightly coloured
and the holes are dark openings in pale wood, both of which separate cleanly by
saturation and brightness, but the table under them is polished metal that throws a
coloured reflection of every piece back at the camera, so a coloured region is only ever
a place worth searching. Which piece stands there is settled by fitting the pieces this
set contains to the edges seen around that place. Depth is asked how tall a piece stands
and usually cannot say: the same reflections leave the depth image with large dropouts
and centimetre-scale noise, far too coarse to measure a thirty millimetre piece. It is
also asked whether a surface is open where it looks solid, which is a step down of a
centimetre to the drawer under the board's lid: a rendering answers that exactly and a
capture of this table does not, so the darkness of a hole is read beside its depth
rather than replaced by it.
