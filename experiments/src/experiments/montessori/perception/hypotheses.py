"""
What perception expects to find, and where it believes it to be.

A detector that only ever fits what colour segmentation isolated can only find what
colour separates. So a look is described instead by the things it expects and the places
it believes them to be in, and finding one is evaluating that expectation against the
picture. Colour is then one of the things that suggests a place, and evidence for what
stands there, rather than the gate everything has to pass to be looked at at all.

Where an expectation comes from is what makes a look knowledge-directed: the picture
suggests some, the world the robot already keeps suggests others, and whatever asked for
the look supplies the rest.
