A ROS node that watches the Montessori scene continuously and answers queries about it.

Run it against the live robot with (the camera and the robot drivers must already be up
via ``ros2 launch iai_tracy_bringup tracy_ros2.launch.py``)::

    python -m experiments.montessori.perception.node

It subscribes to the colour and depth streams, runs
:class:`~experiments.montessori.perception.pipeline.MontessoriPerceptionPipeline` on each
pair, and keeps the newest result. That result is what an entity query language query
evaluated against
:class:`~experiments.montessori.perception.backend.MontessoriPerceptionBackend` is answered from,
and it is also drawn into rviz so the detections can be checked against the real table.
