"""
How a look at the Montessori scene is answered, concluded from what was asked for.

A statement asks for a kind of thing, and what has to be run to answer it differs with
what was asked: a request about the board is answered by finding the board, a request
about the pieces by searching every surface they can rest on. That choice used to be a
branch written into the pipeline, which meant a request nobody foresaw could only be
answered by editing the code that reads it.

It is a rule tree here instead, stated over the request itself -- the description of
what is sought, which is what the rules are asked about and what a condition reads. The
tree is krrood's
:class:`~krrood.entity_query_language.rdr.single_class.EQLSingleClassRDR`, built from
the underspecified statement *a request whose detector is to be worked out*, so what is
described and what is left open are read off that statement rather than named again
here.

Each detector states the requests it can answer as an entity query language condition,
which is
:meth:`~krrood.entity_query_language.backends.PerceptionDetector.capability` and is the
same statement every family of detectors makes about itself, so a detector added to the
rules brings its own condition with it. No two of these say the same, so each rule is
one detector's capability and nothing more.
