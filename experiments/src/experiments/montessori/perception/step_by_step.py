"""
Watch a look narrow itself, one stated condition at a time.

The backend takes a statement one stated condition at a time, and after each one the
picture that is left to search is drawn together with what a look answering that much of
it reports. Two pictures per step: the camera's own image cut to what is left, and the
rectified plane the detectors read, turned the way the camera sees it and with
everything but a stated colour blacked out. Neither carries a mark, since a step is
where there is still to look; a run ends by putting the whole image back on screen with
a box around what the statement found. Each window is named by how the statement reads
so far, so what is on screen and what was asked for are the same sentence.

Everything but the drawing is :class:`SearchNarrowing`, so a run with no window at all
takes the same steps and can be checked without a screen.
