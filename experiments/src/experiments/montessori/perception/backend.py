"""
Answer an :mod:`entity query language <krrood.entity_query_language>` statement about
the Montessori scene by looking at it.

Perception is a backend beside the native and SQLAlchemy ones, so asking and looking are
the same act::

    statement = a(DetectedMontessoriShape)(pose=...)
    statement = statement.where(SupportedBy(statement._variable_, board_lid))
    [seen] = statement.evaluate(backend=MontessoriPerceptionBackend(source=node))
    reach_for = seen.pose

Everything about how a statement is read, narrowed and checked belongs to
:class:`~krrood.entity_query_language.backends.PerceptionBackend` and is the same for
any sensor. What is here is only what is particular to this scene: that a look is taken
by the Montessori pipeline, and which relations its search can narrow itself by.

Four can. *Supported by* names a surface, and a surface is a stretch of a plane the
world already describes, so a look narrowed by it rectifies that stretch instead of the
whole table. Every relation that says where a thing may be -- inside a region, right of
one thing, between two, near a place -- answers the stretch it allows, so the picture is
cut to it before anything is detected. A colour says which pieces are worth fitting at
all, so a look asked for one marks that colour alone. And a turn says which way round to
lay a piece over the edges. What none of them do is decide the answer: each is read
again off what came back.

What a look found stands as a body in a copy of the world it was taken in, so a relation
is evaluated there like any relation of the world -- the colour the body is drawn in,
the way it is turned, whether it touches something -- and what the statement rejects
leaves that world again. Only what the look establishes *differently* from a body is
read off the sighting itself: which surface it searched, and where it reported the thing
standing.
