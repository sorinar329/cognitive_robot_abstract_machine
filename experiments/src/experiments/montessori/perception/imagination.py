"""
The world a look's own findings stand in.

A look reports sightings, and a relation of the world's vocabulary is written over the
things themselves: a body, and whatever the world says about it. So what a look finds is
spawned into a copy of the world it was taken in, where every finding is a body standing
where it was seen and a relation asked about it has something real to be evaluated
against. The world the look was taken in is left as it was, and what a statement rejects
is removed from the copy again, so what the copy holds at the end is the answer.
