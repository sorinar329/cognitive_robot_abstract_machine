Where a look at the Montessori scene comes from.

A source is handed what the look was asked for and answers with what it found. Acting on
the request is a source's own affair: one that takes a fresh look narrows it, while one
serving a look already taken answers with everything it has and leaves the narrowing to
whoever asked.
