"""
Find where a known outline stands, by laying it over the edges the camera saw.

Everything this scene recognises is something whose shape is already known exactly: the
loose pieces have been measured, and the board's holes are cut into a mesh the robot
carries. So recognising one is placing it, and the answer to *where* is whichever
placement follows the seen edges best -- which is a search over positions and turns
rather than a reading of proportions.

The search runs twice: once coarsely and forgivingly over everything a belief allows,
and once finely around the placement that came back. How far the coarse search reaches
and which turns it tries are read from that belief, so a place known closely costs a
fraction of what an unguided pass over the same surface costs.

    which is the same giveaway a rectification re-framed off its own lattice gives, and
