What a camera standing in the twin sees, rendered by MuJoCo.

The fourth place an :class:`~experiments.montessori.perception.camera.RgbdFrame` comes
from, beside a saved capture, a recording and the live camera. Because it answers with
that same frame, whatever reads a look off the real camera reads one off a simulated
scene without knowing the difference, and a backend can be swapped for another without
anything above it changing.

The turn from the way a simulator states a camera's frame to the way a look is read in.

A simulator points a camera down the way a screen is drawn: x to the right of the

optical frame instead -- x to the right, y *down* the picture, and z along the axis the
camera looks down -- so the two are a half turn about x apart. Getting it wrong leaves
every picture upright and every *left of* the wrong way round.

How much of the way to the far plane a reading has to be to count as showing nothing.

A renderer answers with the far plane's own distance for a pixel no surface falls in,
while an

*not measured*, so the two have to be told apart. It is a share of the distance rather
than a distance because the far plane is set from the scene's own size; single-precision
rendering puts the value a fraction either side of it, and nothing a scene holds stands
within a thousandth of a far plane tens of metres away.
