"""
Rectify the colour image onto a horizontal plane, giving a metric top-down view of that
plane.

Everything the board and the shapes need to be told apart is a flat footprint lying on a
known horizontal surface -- the table for the loose shapes, the board's lid for its
holes. Warping the camera view onto that surface removes the perspective the camera
adds, so a contour's area, side lengths, and orientation are read straight off in metres
and in the world frame, and the thresholds that classify it are real dimensions rather
than numbers tied to where the camera happened to stand.
