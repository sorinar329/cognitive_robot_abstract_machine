"""
The plane a depth image measures through a horizontal surface.

Where a camera stands is stated by the world and is only as good as the calibration it
was written down from; the table the camera looks at is flat and at a known height
whatever that calibration says. Fitting a plane through the points the depth image
measures at the table, in the frame the stated pose reports them in, therefore checks
the pose itself: a table that comes out tilted, or at the wrong height, is a camera pose
that is wrong by that tilt and that height.
