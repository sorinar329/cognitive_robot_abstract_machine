The Montessori setup the shipped captures and the recordings they come from were made
on.

Perception reads which stretch of table to search, and how high each surface lies, from
the world the robot publishes -- see
:meth:`~experiments.montessori.perception.pipeline.MontessoriPerceptionPipeline.of_world`.
A recording carries no world, so the two surfaces it was taken over are written down
here, measured off the transform tree those same recordings publish. The live robot
reads only :func:`lab_board` from here: the board on this table, which a look has to
find before the world the robot publishes holds it.
