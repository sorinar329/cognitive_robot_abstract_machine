"""
What perception expects of a Montessori piece the robot has acted on, and how a look at
the scene checks it.

The expectation itself is the general one Segmind keeps -- the relations of the world's
vocabulary a thing is expected to stand in, moved by what each event declares. What is
particular to this scene is how a look is asked for it and how a sighting is checked
against it: a look here is a :class:`SceneRequest`, and a sighting is read the way the
look established it rather than only through the body standing for it.
