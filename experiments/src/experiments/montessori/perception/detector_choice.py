"""
Which detector answers a look, decided from what the robot knows.

A look at a surface can be taken in more than one way, and which way works depends on
things the digital twin already states: how the surface takes light, and whether the
piece being looked for wears a colour that separates it from that surface. So the choice
is made by a rule tree over the look itself -- the surface and the piece as the world
states them -- rather than by a branch written into the pipeline, and it gets better as
the world gains annotations rather than as somebody edits the pipeline.

The tree is krrood's
:class:`~krrood.entity_query_language.rdr.single_class.EQLSingleClassRDR`, built from the
underspecified statement *a look whose detector is to be worked out*, so what is
described and what is left open are read off that statement rather than named again
here.

The choice is made in two parts, which answer different questions:

- **What a detector can answer at all** is the detector's own statement, as an entity
  query language condition over the look (see
  :meth:`~krrood.entity_query_language.backends.PerceptionDetector.capability`). A
  detector is never chosen for a look it declared it cannot answer.
- **Which of the ones that can should**, which is what the rule tree decides.

Neither part subsumes the other. Both detectors here can answer a look at a piece on a
matte surface, so a capability alone leaves the question open; and a tree that named
detectors without asking them would have to be rewritten to gain one.

The tree is a live one. The rules it starts with are written down outright
(:meth:`DetectorRules.rules_stated_at_the_start`), and it grows through
:meth:`~krrood.entity_query_language.backends.DetectorChoice.add_rule`, so a situation
nobody foresaw is given a rule while the rules are in use rather than written into the
code that reads them.
