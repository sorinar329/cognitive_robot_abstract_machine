"""
Looks at the Montessori scene kept in the repository as files.

A capture is what the camera published for one moment -- the colour image byte for byte
as it came off the wire, the depth image registered onto it, and where the camera stood
-- written to disk so the pipeline can be run on real camera data with neither a camera
nor the rosbag it was recorded in. That is what lets a test measure detection against
the real table, and lets a reviewer look at the picture a result was measured on.
