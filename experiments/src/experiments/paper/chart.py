"""
A chart of stretches laid down the seconds of one trial.

What the charts of a card have in common. Whether a row is a kind of event the monitor
reported or one item of the plan the robot ran, it is drawn the same way: a label down
the side, its stretches as bars, and a rule where the query was asked. Kept here so the
charts read against each other on the page rather than only happening to look alike.
