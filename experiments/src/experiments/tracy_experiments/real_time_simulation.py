Runs a world's MuJoCo mirror at wall-clock speed, so the motion can be watched as it
happens.

The background-threaded :class:`~semantic_digital_twin.adapters.multi_sim.MujocoSim`
this repo's other demos use makes a caller's own reads of ``world.state`` a race against
that thread's own writes -- confirmed in the cube-stacking demo as the reason Giskard's
``ParkArmsAction`` could believe a physically-simulated joint had reached its target
without the joint having actually moved. Stepping physics from the calling thread
instead sidesteps that race entirely.
