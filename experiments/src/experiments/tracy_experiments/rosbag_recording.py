"""
Record a rosbag for the span of a demo's execution, optionally keeping only every Nth
frame of the heavy camera streams.

A demo wraps the part of its run worth capturing in a :class:`RosbagRecorder`, which
subscribes to the topics and writes them itself rather than shelling out to ``ros2 bag
record`` -- that has no way to thin a stream, and the camera's registered depth and point
cloud dominate a bag so completely that recording them whole is often not practical.

Messages are subscribed to and written back *serialized*, so nothing is ever
deserialized: decimating a 23 MB point cloud costs a counter increment, not a parse.

The recorder is a context manager rather than a start/stop pair so an exception mid-plan
still closes the bag: a bag that was never closed has no metadata and does not replay.
