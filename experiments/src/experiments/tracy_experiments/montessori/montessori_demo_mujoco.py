Tracy's left arm picks up every loose Montessori shape that has a matching hole and
places it above that hole, with MuJoCo standing in as the real robot: one
:class:`~experiments.tracy_experiments.pick_and_place_action.PickUpActionMujoco`/
:class:`~experiments.tracy_experiments.pick_and_place_action.PlaceActionMujoco` pair per
shape, written out as one flat :func:`~coraplex.plans.factories.sequential` plan
(Tracy's four sorted shapes and their matching holes are fixed by :class:`~experiments.
tracy_experiments.montessori.world.TracyMontessoriWorld`'s own construction, so the plan
does not need to be built dynamically) -- see :mod:`~experiments.tracy_experiments.
pick_and_place_action`'s own docstring for why each action's own leaf motion runs plain
Python (driving MuJoCo actuators directly) rather than a Giskard motion mapping.

See :mod:`~experiments.tracy_experiments.montessori.montessori_demo_real` for the physical-robot
counterpart, which builds its action sequence dynamically from the real
``PickUpAction``/``PlaceAction`` via :func:`~experiments.tracy_experiments.montessori.
montessori_actions.build_sorting_actions` instead.

Run with (the ``iai_tracy_description`` ROS package must be built and sourced)::

a plain top-down grasp (yaw ``0``) closes the fingers across the base edge and the two
corners opposite it -- a 3.7cm span the pads meet only at the corners, skidding the
piece out before either seats. A quarter turn points the closing axis apex-to-base
instead, along the triangle's own altitude: its narrowest span (3.2cm), with one pad
flat on the base face and the other at the apex.
