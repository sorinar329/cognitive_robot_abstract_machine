"""
The physical Tracy's left arm picks up every loose Montessori shape that has a matching
hole and places it above that hole, with the real robot as the real robot: the same
action sequence :mod:`~experiments.tracy_experiments.montessori.montessori_demo_mujoco` builds (see
:func:`~experiments.tracy_experiments.montessori.montessori_actions.build_sorting_actions`), but
from the real ``PickUpAction``/``PlaceAction`` (Giskard-driven, over ROS) instead of
:mod:`~experiments.tracy_experiments.pick_and_place_action`'s MuJoCo-actuator pair.

Wired the way :mod:`coraplex_real_tracy.demo` wires the physical robot: a Giskard
standalone node is launched, the live world is fetched from a running ``WorldFetcher``
service and kept in sync via :class:`~semantic_digital_twin.adapters.ros.
world_synchronizer.WorldSynchronizer`, and the plan runs under
:attr:`~coraplex.datastructures.enums.ExecutionType.REAL`.

Unlike that demo's own boxes, the shape-sorting board and loose shapes are not simple
enough to add as bare bodies: :class:`~experiments.tracy_experiments.montessori.world.
TracyMontessoriWorld` already knows how to build them (mesh, hole cutouts, shape
geometry), so this instead builds one in its own scratch world and merges it onto the
live, fetched world at Tracy's own mount pose -- the same
:meth:`~semantic_digital_twin.world.World.merge_world` machinery
:func:`~experiments.montessori.world.mount_stationary_robot` already uses (in the
opposite role: there a robot is merged into a freshly built scene, here a freshly built
scene is merged onto an already-live robot).

This has not been run against physical hardware; it is structurally wired to the same
pattern as :mod:`coraplex_real_tracy.demo`, and grasp reliability is a known open issue
on the MuJoCo-driven counterpart (see ``TRACY_MONTESSORI_HANDOFF.md``) that is expected
to carry over here.

Run with (``iai_tracy_description`` and the Giskard/world-fetcher ROS stack must be
running)::

    python -m experiments.tracy_experiments.montessori.montessori_demo_real

Pass ``record=True`` to :func:`main` to also record the run; see
``ROSBAG_RECORDING.md``.
