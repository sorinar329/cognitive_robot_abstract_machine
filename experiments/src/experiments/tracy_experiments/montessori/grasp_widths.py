"""
Per-shape close targets for Tracy's Robotiq grippers.

:mod:`~experiments.tracy_experiments.robotiq_gripper` drives the physical gripper to a
single fixed :class:`~experiments.tracy_experiments.robotiq_gripper.FingerSetpoint`
(``0`` fully open, ``0.5`` "closed") for every grasp. ``0.5`` holds the cube, cylinder
and triangular prism but not the thin rectangular prism, which needs the fingers driven
further in before they touch it. This module keeps that one number where it can be
looked up and overridden per
:class:`~experiments.montessori.semantics.MontessoriShapeCategory`, so the real
Montessori demo can size each close to the piece it is about to grasp.

The MuJoCo demo does not need this: its own
:func:`~experiments.tracy_experiments.trajectory_planning.close_gripper_around` already
measures the target body's width and closes to it directly, which the action-server
interface of the physical gripper does not expose.
