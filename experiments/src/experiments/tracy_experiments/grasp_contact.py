"""
Contact friction (sliding, torsional, rolling; see
:attr:`~semantic_digital_twin.adapters.multi_sim.MujocoGeom.friction`) given to every
loose shape's collision geometry.

History of the sliding component: started at ``coraplex_panda_demo``'s own ``1.0``
(tuned for a reliable grip between rubber fingertips, which keep their own separate
friction); lowered to ``0.5`` as an experiment to stop a shape landing centered and
upright on a hole's rim from staying stuck there; tried at ``1.0`` again for every shape
except the cube (a per-category override), which over a 90-run batch traded down overall
(blowup-magnitude physics instability jumped from 10% to 39% of runs, and pass rates for
rectangular_hole and circular_hole_2 fell rather than improving) -- so reverted back to
``0.5`` globally.

Now set to ``0.3``: contact friction is combined by MuJoCo as the element-wise maximum
of the two participating geoms, and the shape-sorting board's own collision geometry had
no friction set at all until :data:`BOARD_FRICTION`, defaulting to MuJoCo's own ``1.0``
sliding friction -- so every shape-board contact was silently pinned at ``1.0`` no
matter what this value was tuned to, and every prior experiment here was only ever
testing the finger-shape grip (where the fingertip's own ``~1.0`` friction dominates
regardless of this value), never the rim-sticking interaction it was meant to fix.
``0.3`` approximates real sliding friction between painted wood/plastic surfaces
(~0.25-0.4), now paired with an equally explicit :data:`BOARD_FRICTION` so the shape-
board contact can actually drop below the finger-dominated grip instead of being masked
by it.
"""

TRIANGULAR_PRISM_GRASP_FRICTION = [1.0, 0.8, 0.02]
"""
Grasp friction (sliding, torsional, rolling) for the triangular prism.

A parallel-jaw gripper can only ever hold this piece with one pad flat on a face and the
other on the opposite vertex; that vertex contact is a line, not a patch, so it pivots
and slides out from between the pads under :data:`GRASP_FRICTION`'s own painted-surface
values. Raised towards the fingertip pads' own rubber friction, with the torsional and
rolling components lifted well above their defaults to resist the pivot specifically.

Approximates real sliding friction between painted wood/plastic surfaces (~0.25-0.4),
matching :data:`GRASP_FRICTION`'s own sliding component so the shape-board contact is
governed by this pair rather than by MuJoCo's own ``1.0`` default the board previously
had no override for (see :data:`GRASP_FRICTION`'s docstring for why that masked every
prior friction experiment). Torsional and rolling use MuJoCo's own defaults rather than
:data:`GRASP_FRICTION`'s grip-stabilizing multiples of them, since the board is never
pinched between fingers.

Stiffer than MuJoCo's own default (``0.02``): a soft contact lets a pinched shape sink
into the fingers and then slip back out as the arm lifts, rather than being held solidly
between them.
