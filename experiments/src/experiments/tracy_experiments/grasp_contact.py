"""
Contact friction (sliding, torsional, rolling; see
:attr:`~semantic_digital_twin.adapters.multi_sim.MujocoGeom.friction`) given to every
loose shape's collision geometry.

History of the sliding component: started at ``coraplex_panda_demo``'s own ``1.0``
(tuned for a reliable grip between rubber fingertips, which keep their own separate
friction); lowered to ``0.5`` as an experiment to stop a shape landing centered and
upright on a hole's rim from staying stuck there; tried at ``1.0`` again for every shape
except the cube (a per-category override), which over a 90-run batch traded down overall
(blowup-magnitude physics instability jumped from 10% to 39% of runs, and pass rates for
rectangular_hole and circular_hole_2 fell rather than improving) -- so reverted back to
``0.5`` globally.

Now set to ``0.3``: contact friction is combined by MuJoCo as the element-wise maximum
of the two participating geoms, and the shape-sorting board's own collision geometry had
no friction set at all until :data:`BOARD_FRICTION`, defaulting to MuJoCo's own ``1.0``
sliding friction -- so every shape-board contact was silently pinned at ``1.0`` no
matter what this value was tuned to, and every prior experiment here was only ever
testing the finger-shape grip (where the fingertip's own ``~1.0`` friction dominates
regardless of this value), never the rim-sticking interaction it was meant to fix.
``0.3`` approximates real sliding friction between painted wood/plastic surfaces
(~0.25-0.4), now paired with an equally explicit :data:`BOARD_FRICTION` so the shape-
board contact can actually drop below the finger-dominated grip instead of being masked
by it.

Per-:class:`~experiments.montessori.semantics.MontessoriShapeCategory` override of

BOARD_FRICTION = [0.3, 0.005, 0.0001]

Contact friction (sliding, torsional, rolling) given to the shape-sorting board's

Approximates real sliding friction between painted wood/plastic surfaces (~0.25-0.4),
matching :data:`GRASP_FRICTION`'s own sliding component so the shape-board contact is
governed by this pair rather than by MuJoCo's own ``1.0`` default the board previously
had no override for (see :data:`GRASP_FRICTION`'s docstring for why that masked every
prior friction experiment). Torsional and rolling use MuJoCo's own defaults rather than
:data:`GRASP_FRICTION`'s grip-stabilizing multiples of them, since the board is never
pinched between fingers.

Contact solver reference (see

Stiffer than MuJoCo's own default (``0.02``): a soft contact lets a pinched shape sink
into the fingers and then slip back out as the arm lifts, rather than being held solidly
between them.

Harder than MuJoCo's own default (``0.9 0.95``), for the same reason as

Contact dimensionality (see

normal.

A shape pinched between two flat pads is held at a few contact points, and with sliding
friction alone nothing resists it turning about the line through them, so a shape held
above its own middle -- every one of them, since the pads reach down only so far --
swings under its own weight as the arm moves and works its way out. Measured on the
triangular prism carried from the table to its hole: with sliding friction alone it tips
by 13 degrees on the way and is dropped on a longer swing, with torsional friction it
stays level to a tenth of a degree. Rolling friction on top of that (6) let the same
prism fall as it was lowered over the hole, so it is not added.
