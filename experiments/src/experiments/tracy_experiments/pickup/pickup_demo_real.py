"""
The physical Tracy's left arm sorts the loose Montessori pieces into the shape-sorting
board by looking -- wired the way :mod:`coraplex_real_tracy.demo` wires the physical
robot: a Giskard standalone node is launched, the live world is fetched and kept in step
through :class:`~experiments.tracy_experiments.live_tracy.LiveTracy`, and the plan runs
under :attr:`~coraplex.datastructures.enums.ExecutionType.REAL`.

Nothing on the table is placed by hand. The camera looks for the board by its
description (:func:`~experiments.montessori.perception.recorded_setup.lab_board`) and
the board found is stood in the live world with one
:class:`~experiments.montessori.semantics.ShapeSortingHole` per hole; one look then
stands every loose piece resting on the bare table where it was seen, as the piece the
set on the table says it is (see
:class:`~experiments.tracy_experiments.pickup.perceived_sorting.PerceivedSorting`).
Board and pieces are visible in the same rviz the physical robot renders in (via
``WorldSynchronizer``), so they can be checked against the real table before the
sorting runs -- the script pauses for that check after looking. Each piece is picked
from where it was seen and released above the hole of the perceived board it fits
through.

Each pick is watched by a SegMind :func:`~experiments.tracy_experiments.montessori.
event_monitoring.build_pick_monitor` monitor -- support, grasp, lift and pick-up, but
no hole-contact or insertion, since the pieces here are bare bodies with no board model.
Its events stream to the live dashboard at ``http://127.0.0.1:5000`` while the demo
runs, and a per-piece yes/no verdict is logged after each pick.

While a piece is carried to its hole, the left gripper's knuckle joint is watched for
slip: the close is re-commanded a little past fully closed on a fixed period and, if the
fingers then travel past where the grasp first settled, the piece has left the pads (see
:mod:`~experiments.tracy_experiments.montessori.gripper_feedback`). Each poll's verdict
is logged, and a slip also shows on the dashboard as a ``GripperSlipEvent``.

The run is recorded as one trial of one episode, the way a simulated run is: every
plan the rig performs, every event its monitors report and the working-memory question
set asked about one piece at the end go onto the trial, and where every joint stood
along the run is kept beside the episode's other artifacts -- with the bag, when one is
recorded -- so the paper's cards can be drawn from the run on the robot exactly as from
a run in MuJoCo.

Run with (the camera, ``iai_tracy_description`` and the Giskard/world-fetcher ROS stack
must be running)::

    python -m experiments.tracy_experiments.pickup.pickup_demo_real

Pass ``--record`` to capture a rosbag of the camera, depth camera and joint states for
the duration of the sorting. Bags are written to
:data:`~experiments.tracy_experiments.rosbag_recording.DEFAULT_BAG_DIRECTORY` and keep
one camera frame in
:data:`~experiments.tracy_experiments.rosbag_recording.DEFAULT_KEEP_EVERY_NTH_FRAME`;
both are overridable, see
``--bag-directory`` and ``--keep-every-nth-frame``.
