:mod:`~experiments.tracy_experiments.pickup.pickup_demo_real` with MuJoCo standing in
for the robot and for the camera: the same run, on the same table, seen through the same
camera, with the robot's own world knowing no more than the real one does.

Two worlds stand for the lab. The *reality* is what the simulation runs: Tracy on its
own table, the shape-sorting board and the smaller set of pieces standing where the tape
put them on 2026-09-11, all of it physics. The *belief* is what the robot plans in, and
it starts as the real demo's fetched world does, holding Tracy and nothing else; the
board and the pieces reach it only by looking, through a camera hung on Tracy's
``camera_link`` at the optical pose the shipped captures carry, rendering the reality.
Every plan is then made in the belief and played back on the reality's actuators, the
belief's joints following the simulated ones, so a piece is picked from where the look
put it and not from where it is.

Run with (the ``iai_tracy_description`` ROS package must be built and sourced)::

    python -m experiments.tracy_experiments.pickup.pickup_demo_mujoco

Pass ``--headless`` to run without the viewer, and ``--video-directory`` to say where the
run's videos -- the whole table from above, and what the robot's camera saw -- and the
picture of what the look found are written.
