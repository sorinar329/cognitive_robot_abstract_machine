"""
What a question of the frozen set is.

A question names what is asked, which of the six kinds of thing it asks about, the level
of Bloom's taxonomy answering it exercises, what has to be represented for it to be
answerable at all, and the query that answers it. The same English question asked of
working memory and of long-term memory is two questions here, because the two exercise
different levels and are therefore scored apart.
