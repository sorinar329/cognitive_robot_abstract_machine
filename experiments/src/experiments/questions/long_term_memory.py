"""
The questions asked of what past runs recorded.

Long-term memory is the episodes in the database, reached through the same query language
a live world is reached through. Answering these exercises remembering: the facts are not
in front of the robot any more, and the query has to get them back out of the store.

..note:: Every one of these crosses a to-many collection an episode holds -- a trial's
    ticks, and a tick's events -- which the generated interface reaches through an
    association table. Nothing in this repository proves the query language translates a
    join across one, and this is the first work that needs it, so the tests here are what
    answers that question.
