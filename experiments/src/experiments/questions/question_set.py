"""
The frozen set of questions the paper is scored on.

What is frozen is the questions themselves -- which ones are asked, in which bucket, of
which memory -- and the roles a scene fills in for the ones that single out one thing.
The things themselves change from scene to scene; the set does not.

The set is read off the questions rather than listed here, so a question joins it by
being written and none can be written and then forgotten.
