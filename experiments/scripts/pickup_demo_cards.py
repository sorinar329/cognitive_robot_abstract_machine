"""
Run the simulated pickup demo as a recorded episode and draw the paper's query cards
from what it recorded.

Two runs are worth drawing, and this script draws either: the robot sorting the pieces
it saw, in which the piece it is asked about was picked up by an item of its own plan;
and the same run with someone shoving that piece across the table after the look and
before the sorting, in which the piece moved while the robot was idle and nothing in the
plan accounts for it.

Usage:
    python3 pickup_demo_cards.py <output-directory> [--shoved] [--piece <shape>]
        [--headless]

The episode's artifacts -- the film of the table, the transcript, and the trial's own
camera film and joint trace -- are kept under the output directory beside a database
holding the trial, and the cards are written beside them. The cards are drawn from the
run itself rather than read back from that database, since the twin the run keeps
there points at mesh files the run wrote for its own lifetime and takes away again.
