"""
The card that says why the answer is yes or no, not only what it is.

Two runs are drawn here, and they are the two the card exists for. Both are about the
same piece and both end with it somewhere else; what tells them apart is *when*.

In one the robot picked it up: a pick-up was reported while the item of the plan that
picks that piece up was running. In the other a person shoved it while the robot was
still idle -- the plan's pick-up of that same piece does not start until later -- so a
translation was reported at a moment nothing was running to account for it. The four
levels are what lets a reader see that difference.
