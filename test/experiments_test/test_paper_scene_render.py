"""
Picking an answer out of the twin: the things a query answered drawn in one colour and
everything else faded behind them, which is what a reader of the paper is shown beside
the query.

The colouring is asserted off the scene the render builds, which needs no graphics at
all; only the two tests that actually draw a picture need a backend that can render with
no window, and those are skipped where the run named none.
