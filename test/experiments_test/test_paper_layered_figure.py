A card's levels drawn one above another as a single picture.

Four separate figures float apart on a page and are read in whatever order the layout
puts them; one picture with the levels stacked is read straight down, which is the whole
point of showing an event over the plan that was running over what the camera saw. None
of this needs a renderer: the levels are already pictures by the time they get here.
