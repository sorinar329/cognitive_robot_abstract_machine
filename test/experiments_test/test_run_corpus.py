"""
Recording a corpus of episodes and asking every one of them back.

The corpus's own work is which episodes it covers, that each is named in the manifest,
and that every episode is asked the long-term-memory set as often as the corpus asks --
not the simulation each episode runs, which the single-episode script's own tests cover.
So the episodes here are recorded by a recorder that keeps a trial without simulating
anything, and the corpus is recorded to a database in memory.
