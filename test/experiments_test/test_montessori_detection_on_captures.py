"""
What the pipeline finds in the captures taken off the real camera.

These are the only tests that measure detection against the physical table rather than
against a rendered scene, so they are where a change to the detectors is judged. Each
capture states what it really holds
(:data:`~experiments_test.dataset.montessori_capture_fixtures.CAPTURE_TRUTHS`), and the
tests below say which parts of that the pipeline gets right today.

A test marked expected-to-fail names the plan item that will make it pass; the mark is
strict, so the day that item lands the test reports the mark as stale rather than
quietly passing.

tell it differs between these four, and only one kind of telling exists on a capture.

Two of them - ``disoriented_cube_on_hole`` and ``displaced_cube_from_hole`` - are a cube
an insertion put at a named hole, so a history does say where to look, and armed with it
the cube *is* fitted. Whether it is fitted is not stable in how far the belief is stated

24 mm or 30 mm, because the agreement landscape over the lid is flat enough that which
peak a coarse pass settles on decides the answer. Separating a piece from a ghost that
follows the same edges is ``competing-explanations``, and no reach can be stated that
does it here.

The other two are pieces nothing acted on, so no history says anything about them, and a
