"""
The board's holes as one rigid layout, and the fit that lays it over what was seen.

A hole given three degrees of freedom of its own lands wherever the picture happens to
agree with it, which is how the per-contour classifier put five holes inside ninety
millimetres of a board whose own mesh spreads them over a hundred and eighty. These
tests hold the two halves of the answer: the layout is exactly what the mesh was cut
with, and fitting it moves all six holes together.
