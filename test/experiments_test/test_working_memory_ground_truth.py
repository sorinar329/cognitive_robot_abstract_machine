"""
Where the true answer to a working-memory question comes from: what the run knows it set
up, rather than a second reading of the twin the question is answered from.

A scene a run stood and a scene a look misread are one twin to a query, so a true answer
read off that twin agrees with every answer whatever the twin holds. Each case here
states what the run stood, leaves the twin holding what a look would have made of it,
and asks whether the score follows.
