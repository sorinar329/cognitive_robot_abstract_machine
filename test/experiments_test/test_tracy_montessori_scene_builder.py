Tests for :mod:`experiments.tracy_experiments.montessori.scene_builder`: the scene a run
on Tracy is set in is either built from Tracy's description or stood in the world the
robot publishes by its own camera, and a run on the robot over the perceived scene is
watched, asked and recorded without any simulation -- measured on the capture whose
table was laid out with a tape, in the world Tracy's own description gives.
