Collecting what a trial's runner cannot see - when it began, the monitor's ticks, the
questions asked, the plans performed, the insertions attempted and the motions run - and
writing it onto the trial that was recorded.

The trial is built on the recording scenario of :mod:`test_scenarios`, so nothing here
needs a simulator; the questions are asked of the two-arm scene of
:mod:`test_questions`, which is what the frozen set can be scored against.
