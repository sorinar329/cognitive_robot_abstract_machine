"""
A small world an expectation can be stated over: a plate with one square hole cut
through it, and a cube standing in the hole, on the plate over it, or lifted clear of
it.

It stands in for any surface a hole is cut through -- a board's lid, a wall -- so what
is tested here is the pattern, not the Montessori board.
