The throwaway git repository the hook integration tests run against.

Every hook in this directory reads git config, fetches a personal-notes branch, or
pushes to one, so testing any of them needs a real repository with a real remote. Both
are built locally here - a project root, and a bare repository standing in for the
notes remote - so no test needs network access or a real personal-notes branch.
