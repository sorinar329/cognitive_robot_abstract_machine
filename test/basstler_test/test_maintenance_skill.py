"""
The one thing about the maintenance skill worth asserting from code.

The skill is instructions, so most of what it says can only be checked by reading it.
The exception is what it must *not* say: it runs on whichever fork invoked it, so a
repository named in it is an instruction to operate on somebody else's. That is an
absence, computed from this checkout's own remotes rather than from a string written
here, which is what makes it worth a test where a prose assertion would not be.
