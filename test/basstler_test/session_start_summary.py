"""
Reading session-start.sh's summary report back in a test.

The hook's report is its only observable output, so more than one test module asserts
against it; both halves of doing so live here rather than being written out again in
each of them - parsing a line out of the report, and rendering the line the report is
expected to carry from the same definitions the hook prints it from.

.. note::
   Rendering an expectation rather than restating it means a reword moves both sides at
   once, so wording is deliberately not what these tests pin.
