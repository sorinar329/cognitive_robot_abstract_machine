"""
Unit tests for :class:`NumericPose` and the pose reads that go through it.

A pose read that builds a CasADi expression cannot be done from a second thread: CasADi
releases the GIL and counts its expression-node references without atomics, so two
threads reading poses free nodes each other still hold. These tests pin down that the
numeric read path returns the same numbers as the symbolic one and that it reaches them
without building any symbolic expression.
