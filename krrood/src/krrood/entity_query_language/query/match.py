"""
Pattern-matching helpers for the Entity Query Language.

This module provides high-level match abstractions that build symbolic expressions for
variables and attributes from concise, readable matching syntax.

The match classes keep their own noun state in underscore-wrapped names (``_type_``,
``_variable_``, ...), following the convention of
:class:`~krrood.entity_query_language.core.mapped_variable.CanBehaveLikeAVariable`: the
public attribute namespace of a :class:`Match` belongs to the matched class, whose
fields are reachable directly as symbolic attributes.
