"""
RDR backend for underspecified EQL queries.

An underspecified ``Match`` marks the attribute to infer with ``...``, filters the
domain with its concrete keyword arguments, and supplies the instances to complete —
``an(Animal)(milk=True, species=...).from_(animals)``. This backend answers such a query
by inferring the marked attribute on each instance the filter keeps.

It keeps one :class:`~krrood.entity_query_language.rdr.single_class.EQLSingleClassRDR`
for each attribute of each type it is asked about, and fits a model it does not have yet
before inferring through it.
