# Plan Transformations

An action describes the plan it expands into itself. A plan transformation changes that plan from
the outside: it is applied to every node it matches, right after that node has been expanded and
before the nodes below it are expanded in turn.

That makes transformations the place for behaviour that is not part of an action's own description,
such as perceiving before a grasp or parking the arms before driving, without giving every action a
parameter for it. Transformations are registered on the `Context`, next to the alternative motion
mappings, so they hold for every plan built with that context.

# Setup a World

```python
from coraplex.datastructures.dataclasses import Context
from coraplex.execution_environment import simulated_robot
from coraplex.testing import setup_world
from semantic_digital_twin.robots.pr2 import PR2

world = setup_world()

pr2 = PR2.from_world(world)

context = Context(world, pr2)
```

## Looking at a Plan

Every node carries the short label the plan visualization puts on it, so a few lines are enough to
print an expanded plan:

```python
def show(node, depth=0):
    print("   " * depth + node.node_label)
    for child in node.children:
        show(child, depth + 1)
```

## A Reach Without Transformations

`ReachAction` moves the gripper to a pre-pose and then makes its final approach onto the object. The
plan is built by `notify`, which expands the whole plan without executing it.

```python
from coraplex.plans.factories import execute_single
from coraplex.robot_plans.actions.core.pick_up import ReachAction
from semantic_digital_twin.semantic_annotations.semantic_annotations import Milk
from semantic_digital_twin.spatial_types.spatial_types import Pose

milk = world.get_semantic_annotations_by_type(Milk)[0]
grasp = milk.grasp_candidates()[0]

reach = execute_single(ReachAction(grasp=grasp, arm=pr2.right_arm), context=context)
reach.notify()

show(reach)
```

The two `MoveToolCenterPointMotion` nodes are the pre-pose and the final approach; the condition
nodes around them are the action's pre- and postcondition. The approach grasps at the pose the world
already holds.

## Detecting Before the Grasp

`DetectBeforeGrasp` looks at the object and detects it in front of that final approach, so the
approach acts on a freshly perceived pose. Registering it is the whole change:

```python
from coraplex.robot_plans.plan_transformations import DetectBeforeGrasp

context.plan_transformations.append(DetectBeforeGrasp())

reach = execute_single(ReachAction(grasp=grasp, arm=pr2.right_arm), context=context)
reach.notify()

show(reach)
```

A node is expanded once, so each section builds its own plan rather than expanding the previous one
again. The look and the detection now sit between the pre-pose and the approach, and both were
expanded in turn: each has a plan of its own below it.

The same plan as an interactive graph:

```python
reach.plan.visualize()
```

A transformation fires wherever its action is expanded, so the one registration also covers the
reach that `PickUpAction` builds. Nothing has to be passed down to it:

```python
from coraplex.robot_plans.actions.core.pick_up import PickUpAction

pick_up = execute_single(PickUpAction(grasp, pr2.right_arm), context=context)
pick_up.notify()

show(pick_up)
```

Running such a plan needs a perception source to answer the detection, which is why this notebook
stops at the expanded plan here. The next section performs a plan that a transformation rewrote.

## Opening What the Object Lies In

`OpenDrawerBeforePickUp` puts an opening of the drawer in front of a pick-up whose object lies in one,
followed by parking the arms and driving back to where the object can be reached from. The opening is
a move-and-open step, so where the robot stands to open the drawer is tried together with the opening
itself. To see it, the apartment needs a drawer that something lies in — a spoon in the top
drawer of cabinet 10:

```python
import os

import coraplex
from semantic_digital_twin.adapters.mesh import STLParser
from semantic_digital_twin.semantic_annotations.semantic_annotations import Drawer, Handle, Spoon
from semantic_digital_twin.spatial_types import HomogeneousTransformationMatrix
from semantic_digital_twin.world_description.connections import FixedConnection

spoon = STLParser(
    os.path.join(
        os.path.dirname(coraplex.__file__), "..", "..", "resources", "objects", "spoon.stl"
    )
).parse()

with world.modify_world():
    world.merge_world(
        spoon,
        FixedConnection(
            parent=world.get_body_by_name("cabinet10_drawer_top"),
            child=spoon.root,
            parent_T_connection_expression=HomogeneousTransformationMatrix.from_xyz_rpy(
                -0.05, -0.05, 0
            ),
        ),
    )

with world.modify_world():
    world.add_semantic_annotation(Spoon(root=world.get_body_by_name("spoon.stl")))
    world.add_semantic_annotation_recursively(
        Drawer(
            root=world.get_body_by_name("cabinet10_drawer_top"),
            handle=Handle(root=world.get_body_by_name("handle_cab10_t")),
        )
    )
```

The transformation is bound to `PickUpAction`, so it inserts next to the pick-up rather than inside
it. That needs the pick-up to have a parent, which the surrounding `sequential` gives it:

```python
from coraplex.plans.factories import sequential
from coraplex.robot_plans.plan_transformations import OpenDrawerBeforePickUp

context.plan_transformations = [OpenDrawerBeforePickUp()]

spoon_annotation = world.get_semantic_annotations_by_type(Spoon)[0]

pick_up = sequential(
    [PickUpAction(spoon_annotation.grasp_candidates()[0], pr2.right_arm)], context
)
pick_up.notify()

show(pick_up)
```

The opening, the parking and the drive back to the spoon now precede the pick-up. The opening and the
drive are grounded when they are run, and the parking was expanded in turn. The milk stands in the
open, so the same registration leaves its pick-up alone:

```python
milk_pick_up = sequential([PickUpAction(grasp, pr2.right_arm)], context)
milk_pick_up.notify()

show(milk_pick_up)
```

## Writing a Transformation

A transformation says which nodes it applies to and how their plan changes. Which nodes it applies
to is the type it is bound to: `PlanTransformation[NavigateAction]` matches the node of every
navigation, since a navigation is a designator, and a node type in that place matches every node of
that type instead. `matches_node` does that selection, and `is_applicable` says whether the case a
matched node describes needs the transformation at all, so one that is always worth applying
answers `True`.

How the plan changes is what the subclass brings. `InsertionTransformation` inserts nodes and asks
for the `position` they are placed at, the `anchor` they are placed next to, and the
`nodes_to_insert`, which are built anew on every application, since a node belongs to the one plan
it was inserted into.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

from typing_extensions import List

from coraplex.datastructures.enums import InsertionPosition
from coraplex.plans.plan_node import ActionLike, ActionNode, MotionNode, PlanNode
from coraplex.plans.plan_transformation import InsertionTransformation
from coraplex.robot_plans.actions.core.navigation import NavigateAction
from coraplex.robot_plans.actions.core.robot_body import ParkArmsAction


@dataclass
class ParkArmsBeforeNavigating(InsertionTransformation[NavigateAction]):
    """
    Parks the arms before the robot drives off, so it does not carry them into the
    furniture it passes.
    """

    @property
    def position(self) -> InsertionPosition:
        return InsertionPosition.BEFORE

    def is_applicable(self, plan_node: PlanNode) -> bool:
        return True

    def anchor(self, plan_node: ActionNode) -> PlanNode:
        [drive] = [
            node for node in plan_node.descendants if isinstance(node, MotionNode)
        ]
        return drive

    def nodes_to_insert(self, plan_node: ActionNode) -> List[ActionLike]:
        return [ParkArmsAction(plan_node.action.robot.all_arms)]
```

```python
context.plan_transformations = [ParkArmsBeforeNavigating()]

navigate = execute_single(
    NavigateAction(Pose.from_xyz_rpy(1.5, 2.4, 0.0, reference_frame=world.root)),
    context=context,
)
navigate.notify()

show(navigate)
```

The parking is part of the plan like any other action, so it is performed with it:

```python
with simulated_robot:
    navigate.perform()

print(navigate.status)
```

## Where the Nodes Land

Every insertion says where its nodes go: `BEFORE` or `AFTER` the anchor makes them its siblings,
`LAST_CHILD` appends them to what the anchor expanded into. The position is part of what the rewrite
is rather than something its caller passes, so parking once the robot has arrived is a rewrite of
its own:

```python
@dataclass
class ParkArmsAfterNavigating(ParkArmsBeforeNavigating):
    """
    Parks the arms once the robot has arrived instead of before it drives off.
    """

    @property
    def position(self) -> InsertionPosition:
        return InsertionPosition.AFTER


context.plan_transformations = [ParkArmsAfterNavigating()]

navigate = execute_single(
    NavigateAction(Pose.from_xyz_rpy(1.5, 2.4, 0.0, reference_frame=world.root)),
    context=context,
)
navigate.notify()

show(navigate)
```

A transformation that is not needed in every case answers `is_applicable` with the question its
case asks, and is only asked about the nodes it matches. Here the arms are only parked before
drives that actually take the robot somewhere:

```python
@dataclass
class ParkArmsBeforeLongDrives(ParkArmsBeforeNavigating):
    """
    Parks the arms only before drives that take the robot somewhere else, not before one
    that leaves it where it already stands.
    """

    minimum_distance: float = 0.5
    """
    How far a drive has to take the robot for parking the arms to be worth it.
    """

    def is_applicable(self, plan_node: PlanNode) -> bool:
        navigate = plan_node.designator
        target = navigate.world.transform(navigate.target_location, navigate.world.root)
        distance = navigate.robot.root.global_pose.to_position().euclidean_distance(
            target.to_position()
        )
        return float(distance) > self.minimum_distance
```

```python
context.plan_transformations = [ParkArmsBeforeLongDrives()]

navigate = execute_single(NavigateAction(pr2.root.global_pose), context=context)
navigate.notify()

show(navigate)
```

This drive leaves the robot where it already stands, so the transformation leaves its plan alone.
