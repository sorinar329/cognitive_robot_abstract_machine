# Action Conditions

Actions in CoraPlex have pre -and postconditions which describe certain conditions of the world or the robot that have to
be satisfied for the action to be successfully executed. While the exact conditions for an action depend heavily on the
type of action as well as the context in which it is executed.
Usually it is easier to write conditions for more complex actions since they are more narrow in scope and are already more
restricted by their semantic.
However, the conditions of the actions currently defined are the minimal set of conditions that could reasonably be assumed.

## EQL and Conditions

Pre -and Postconditions in CoraPlex are written in the Entity Query Language [EQL](https://cram2.github.io/cognitive_robot_abstract_machine/krrood/eql/intro.html). which allow to query the current state
of the world with SQL like queries.
A Precondition consists of variables which are used in predicates that form the condition itself. An EQL variable represents
a value of a certain type in a domain, the role of EQL is to find a set of values for the variables such that the condition is
satisfied.
The variables in conditions can be created in two ways:
    * Bound: The domain of the variable is only the value of the action
    * Unbound: The domain of the variable is a set of all values in the world that could be used for the variable.

This allows for two use-cases: conditions with bound variables represent exactly the situation of the action and can be
evaluated to determine if the action is feasible or not.
On the other hand a condition with unbound variables can  be used to query the world state to find values for the variables
that satisfy the condition. This allows to find parameter for actions which make them executable. This can also be used in
Partial Designator to find parameter for under-specified actions.

## Example

As an example we will look at the pre condition for the {class}`~coraplex.robot_plans.actions.core.pick_up.PickUpAction`.
In general the pre -and postcondition can be anything that is an EQL predicate, a symbolic function or something that
evaluates to bool. Conditions are defined as static methods that receive the EQL `variables`, the execution
`context` and the action `kwargs`.

```python
@staticmethod
def pre_condition(variables, context, kwargs):
    return GripperIsFree(variables["arm"].end_effector)
```

The condition is that the gripper that should pick up the object is free and not holding anything
({class}`~coraplex.querying.predicates.GripperIsFree`). The arm is the queried variable here, since querying over other
parameter (like the object to be picked up) would result in very unexpected behaviour of the plan.

Preconditions are cheap checks of the current state that tell whether an action is plausible at all. They do not ask
whether the robot can actually reach its target: an underspecified action finds that out by trying each candidate in a
copy of the world before it is executed (see {doc}`resolvers`).

Now imagine the following scenario, the robot should pick up an object but is already holding something in the
specified arm. Querying the arm as a variable finds the other arm, whose gripper is free, and with it a PickUp Action
that can be executed.
