"""
The PR2 lays a place setting: it carries the milk, a bowl and a spoon onto the table.

Runs in simulation against the apartment, so nothing on the network is needed. The
scaffolding in :mod:`coraplex.demonstrations` owns the ROS session and publishes the
world to Rviz, so the run can be watched while it happens.

Every transport leaves the grasp and the standing pose open: each pair is tried out
before it is executed, and the first that succeeds is taken. The bowl shows why, as only
some of the grasps around its rim can be reached from where the robot may stand.

While the plan runs, SegMind segments it into the grasps, pick-ups, placings and
containments of the place setting, and reports them once the plan is done.
