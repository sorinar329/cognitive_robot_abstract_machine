@dataclass
class ActionTrial:
    """
    Tries grounded actions against a disposable copy of the world, to check that a
    candidate can succeed before it is attempted for real.

    One copy serves every candidate: after an attempt the copy is rolled back to the
    model version it was at and its state is restored, so the next candidate starts from
    the same point without another copy having to be made. A fresh copy is taken
    whenever `context.world` has itself moved on, so a trial always reflects the state
    and model changes actually in it.

    The copy is never connected to a synchronizer, so nothing a trial does is published,
    and a trial always runs under a forced
    :attr:`~coraplex.datastructures.enums.ExecutionType.SIMULATED` execution regardless
    of the execution type the real attempt will use. Conditions are always evaluated
    too: whether a candidate is worth attempting for real is exactly what its pre- and
    postconditions decide, so a plan that skips them elsewhere does not skip them here.

        belong to the world being modified.

        The version to roll back to is read here rather than when the copy is taken, so
        each attempt undoes only its own modifications. Reverting is itself recorded, so
