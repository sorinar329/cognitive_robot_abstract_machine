# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#            Map all Designators, that are not self-mapping, here.
#            By default all classes are self-mapping, so you only need to add the ones where not every attribute is
#            supposed to be mapped or where an attribute is from a type, which is not mapped itself.
#            Specify the columns(attributes) that are supposed to be tracked in the database.
#            One attribute equals one column. Please refer to the ORMatic documentation for more information.
