    Turns ``True`` while :attr:`monitored_task` is not closing on its goal fast enough.

    The task counts as approaching its goal while its error lies below the error it had
    when it last made progress, by at least :attr:`minimum_convergence_rate` times its
    threshold for every second since. An error that moves without getting smaller, as
    it does for an arm that collision avoidance keeps pushing back, therefore never
    counts as approaching, however fast it moves.

    A task that is not running has no meaningful progress, so it is reported as not
    approaching. That makes this node safe to combine with others, but it means the
    node only says something useful about a task while that task runs.

    A task that has reached its goal is reported as not approaching too: its error can
    keep moving within the threshold for as long as it holds the goal, as a grip held
    while something else moves does, and that movement is not progress. Counting it
    would keep a motion whose other tasks are stuck from ever being given up on.

        this node on its own is not evidence that a task is stuck.
