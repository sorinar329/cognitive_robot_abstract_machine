    Fraction of the distance to the nearest constraint that piqp is allowed to step.

    Our problems regularly put a constraint right where the solution lies: a joint braking
    at its position limit, or a box collapsed to almost nothing. At piqp's default of 0.99
    the iterates then press against that constraint and stop improving, and the solve ends
    at the iteration limit with a dual residual it can no longer reduce. Keeping the steps
    further inside the feasible region leaves the iterates room to move along such a
    constraint instead. Every value from 0.8 to 0.98 solves all of the problems recorded
    from the test suites; 0.95 sits in the middle of that range and costs about a sixth
    more iterations than 0.99 on the problems that converge either way.
