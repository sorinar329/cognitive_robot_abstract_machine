# Reports whether this clone has everything the .claude/ agent tooling needs -
# personal notes, PR progress, plan dashboards - so a session (or a person) can
# tell in one call what is already set up and what still needs doing.
#
# Usage (from anywhere - always inspects this repo specifically, see
# resolve-personal-notes-config.sh):
#   ./.claude/hooks/check-setup.sh
#
# Read-only: it fetches (into FETCH_HEAD) and reads git config, but never
# writes config, branches, files, or remotes. Running it can't change the
# answer it gives.
#
# Output is one tab-separated "<check>\t<status>\t<detail>" row per check, in
# the order the checks have to be fixed in (a later one can depend on an
# earlier one being satisfied). Three statuses:
#   ok           - nothing to do
#   needs-setup  - something is missing; <detail> says what
#   info         - context for whoever is reading, never a pass/fail
# Exit code is 0 when no row is needs-setup, 1 otherwise - so a caller can
# take the fast path ("everything is already fine") on the exit code alone,
# without parsing anything.
#
# TSV rather than JSON for the same reason the plan branch index is TSV (see
# plan_id_for_branch in ./resolve-personal-notes-config.sh): a tab can't occur
# inside any value here, and it needs nothing beyond the shell itself - this
# script must not gain a dependency just to describe whether dependencies are
# installed.
#
# The one thing it deliberately does not check is GitHub API access, which
# /plan-dashboard needs for live pull request state: that is reachable only
# through a session's MCP tools, not from a shell. The same goes for the pull
# request labels the dashboard reads. .claude/skills/setup-personal-notes
# covers both as their own steps.
