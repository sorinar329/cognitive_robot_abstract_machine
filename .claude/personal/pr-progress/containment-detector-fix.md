## containment-detector-fix: Segmind's ContainmentDetector slows the bullet world demo

Branch from sorin/main (0c5a90f8c1, after PR #670 segmind-live-1 merge), 2026-10-06.
Very high priority todo. Claim to verify first (pasted by user): bullet world demo
309 s with Segmind vs 195 s without (+115 s, ~60%); a tick ~0.9 s, ~97% in
ContainmentDetector.get_containment_pairs -> InsideOf.compute_containment_ratio 432x per
tick (3 watched objects x 144 bodies outside the hands).

Plan: 1. measure off / on / instrumented runs of coraplex_bullet_world_demo (running).
2. report to user; then fix test-first (no code changes yet).
Observations: get_containment_pairs uses bodies_outside_end_effectors directly, so it
skips bodies_left_out (robot bodies) unlike get_relation; each ratio call copies and
transforms both meshes and builds the container's bounding box; Segmind's tick loop
waits as long as the tick held the world lock, so tick cost roughly doubles in plan time.
